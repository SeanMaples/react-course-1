# Week 3

## Lesson 9: Use Event Handlers with React
**Video**: [Use Event Handlers with React](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-use-event-handlers-with-react?pl=the-beginner-s-guide-to-react-2017-99bf)

### Resources
- [Handling Events in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
- [Supported Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events)
  - Note: Event names in React are the same as the DOM event names they emulate; except that React event names are camel-cased and DOM event names are lower-cased. For instance the `onMouseMove` React event is analagous to the [`onmousemove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousemove_event) DOM event.


## Lesson 10: Use Component State with React
**Video**: [Use Component State with React](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-use-component-state-with-react?pl=the-beginner-s-guide-to-react-2017-99bf)

### Resources
- [Function and Class Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components)
- [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
- [Defining Classes in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

#### In-Depth: Object Orented JavaScript
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and classes are the subjects of many, many books, and so thorough treatments of either is well beyond the scope of this React course. However, if you are interested in a deeper dive into OOP and classes in JavaScript, I've inclued a couple of resource below.
- [Code Academy: Interactive Classes Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript/modules/learn-javascript-classes)
- [Object Oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS)

## Notes

### Additional Week of Content Next Week
We've reached a point in the content where the new version of the React course diverges significantly from our version. The new version introduces the [React Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and uses hooks in its examples for the remainder of the course.

> **Note:** The Hooks API is a set of features that enables creating complex, state-based components using only functions instead of classes.

Our current version uses class-based components instead. Since many of React components at Lex Machina are class-based, I think it's worth learning the class-based way of doing things. However, Hooks does appear to be the future of React, so I think it's worth pulling that content in as well. To achieve that I'm inserting another week of lessons in between week 3 and 4 (next week). Rather than renumbering everything after week 3, I'm just going to call this additional week, "week 3.5."
